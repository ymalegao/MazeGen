        <h2> Project Overview</h2>            
        <div class="description">
            <p>Our project is a maze generator. Every time you run the project there is a unique maze that is generated, and the player always spawns in a starter position every time, the player being a cube. Using wasd the player can be moved, and using the arrow keys the camera can be moved. The player can move around the maze and can collect the pellets. You have to watch out for the AI that will hurt you if you touch them.</p>
            <p>Each created maze creates paths that both the player and the enemy can take, and like Pac-Man, the paths are lined with pellets that contribute to an overall scoring system. To create new mazes, the generate button must be clicked and a layout will be constructed. The pellets and characters will be reset as well.            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>The goal of our project is to have a playable example of generation mechanics that were taught throughout this class. We wanted our project to be able to have a player character with movement, that can collect some sort of treasure and escape from an enemy, all while traversing a procedurally generated maze. </p>
        </div>

        <h2> Game Mechanics and Features </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Player (Blue) has 3 Lives</li>
            <li>Press the generate button to generate new maze outline</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="indented">Able to generate at any given time</li>
                <li class="indented">New maze color (walls)</li>
                <li class="indented">Resets player position</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Can collect pellets spread all across the maze</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="indented">Game keeps track of pellets collected as score</li>
                <li class="indented">If a power pellet is collected, the AI goes into “fear mode”</li>
            </ul>
            <li>AI agent (Red) moves around the maze</li>
            <ul>
                <li class="indented">If player touches agent, player loses a life</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Change camera angle by pressing 1, 2, or 3</li>
        </ul>
